# forecast-demand-for-vending-machines
**WORK IN PROGRESS** This pattern will demonstrate the methodology to forecast the demand for cash vending machines so that cash replenishment can be optimized. If the cash replenishment is optimized then it will avoid cash outs and helps in enhancing customer experience and increases the revenue for the financial institution. We will mimic the cash withdrawal pattern using Deep Learning (AI) to churn out accurate forecast by using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). LSTM is known to remember long sequences over time and we will demonstrate how it can accurately forecast the demand.
